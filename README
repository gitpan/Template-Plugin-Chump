Template::Plugin::Chump - provides a Template Toolkit filter for Chump like syntax

=head1 SYNOPSIS

	[% USE Chump %]

	<html>
	<body>

	[% FILTER chump %]

	This will get turned into a clickable link
	http://something.com 

	This will turn the word 'foo' into a link to bar.com
	[foo|http://bar.com]

	This will get turned into an inline image with the label 'foo'
	+[bar|http://foo.com/quux.jpg]

	[% END %]

	And this will do what you expect
	[% somevar FILTER chump %]

	[% Chump.new_type('equal','=', subref,'rege+xp') %]
	[% FILTER chump %]
	=[foo|regeeeeexp]
	[% END %]
	the subroutine subref will now be called.

	[% FILTER chump( {links=>0}) %]
	links won't be parsed so this ...
	[foo|http://bar.com]
	will remain as is
	[% END %]	
	
	</body>
	</html>
