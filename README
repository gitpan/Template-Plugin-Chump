README for Template::Plugin::Chump 1.2

=head1 NAME

Template::Plugin::Chump - provides a Template Toolkit filter for Chump like syntax

=head1 SYNOPSIS

	[% USE Chump %]

	<html>
	<body>

	[% FILTER chump %]

	This will get turned into a clickable link
	http://something.com 

	This will turn the word 'foo' into a link to bar.com
	[foo|http://bar.com]

	This will get turned into an image link 
    +[http://foo.com/quux.jpg]

	This will get turned into an inline image with the label 'bar'
	+[bar|http://foo.com/quux.jpg]

    This will get turned into an image with the label 'bar' which 
    is a link to http://foobar.com
    +[bar|http://foobar.com|http://url.of.image.com/image.jpg]


	[% END %]

	And this will do what you expect
	[% somevar FILTER chump %]

	[% Chump.new_type('equal','=', subref,'rege+xp') %]
	[% FILTER chump %]
	=[foo|regeeeeexp]
	[% END %]
	the subroutine subref will now be called for all links 
    of the format =[<stuff>]

	[% FILTER chump( {links=>0}) %]
	links won't be parsed so this ...
	[foo|http://bar.com]
	will remain as is
	[% END %]	
	
	</body>
	</html>

Alternatively you can pass in a Text::Chump object and use that.


	[% USE Chump({ chump => my_chump_object }) %]
